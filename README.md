## 🇺🇸 Data manipulation: U.S. Elections Historical Data (1976-2020) + Allan Lichtman Keys 🇺🇸

## 🗳️ Introduction

With the upcoming 2024 U.S. elections drawing global attention 🌍, the question of who will win the presidency has never been more pressing. This basic project focuses on creating and analyzing a new dataset **(debuting here, not on Kaggle (at least one part of it!))** that combines the **Lichtman Keys 🔑** — a renowned system for predicting presidential election outcomes — with historical data from 1976 to 2020 📊. By doing so, it provides fresh insights that could potentially be used for future predictions leveraging (AI(ML|DL|GenAI), including this year's pivotal race 🏛️. 

🗒️ Note:

Please note that this dataset assumes that every state contributes a certain key, which may not strictly reflect the true state-level contributions. However, due to limitations in available data, it is used a national-level assumption for the keys rather than state-level specifics. This approach serves the purpose of providing a broader national analysis for simulation purposes.

## 🔑 What are the Lichtman Keys?

The **Lichtman Keys** were developed by political historian Allan Lichtman 📚. They are a series of **13 true/false statements** designed to assess the likelihood of the incumbent party 🏛️ retaining the White House. The system has been remarkably and strangely accurate, correctly predicting the outcome of almost every U.S. presidential election.

If **six or more keys turn false**, the incumbent party is likely to lose the presidency, whereas fewer than six suggest the incumbent will win 🏆.
